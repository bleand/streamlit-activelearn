    "## Simple Active Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows a very simple implementation of active learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active learn is a technique that can enable data scientist to generate a labeled dataset from an unlabeled one easier than labeling it completely.\n",
    "There is labeling involved, but this process uses a model to identify the best samples to annotate reducing the time that it takes and providing immediate feedback on when the dataset is good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Learn can be splitted into 3 steps.\n",
    "* 1: Seeding\n",
    "* 2: Similarity\n",
    "* 3: Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "On 1, we provide seeds (i.e. samples of each class) to identify potentially easy datapoints.\n",
    "Then, we do a similarity search on the dataset and present other similar samples that could be also used as starting points.\n",
    "Finally, we iterate by training a model with the current dataset, making predictions in the unlabeled dataset, and the best samples to annotate next. This last step can be repeated until we are pleased with the metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note, that though the first two steps are not strictly necessary and one can jump right to the iteration, providing seeds helps the model to find the right samples sooner and could save precious time."
